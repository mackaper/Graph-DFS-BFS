# Graph Algorithms Assignment

This repository contains my implementation of the Graph Algorithms assignment for the DD1338 course at KTH. The project involves implementing and testing graph-related functionalities, focusing on the use of Depth-First Search (DFS) and Breadth-First Search (BFS) for solving fundamental graph problems.

## Key Highlights

- **Graph Implementation:** Developed an undirected, weighted graph using an adjacency list with support for adding, removing, and querying edges and vertices.
- **Cycle Detection:** Implemented a DFS-based algorithm to determine whether a graph contains cycles, including handling graphs with multiple components.
- **Pathfinding:** Used BFS to solve the shortest path problem, identifying whether a path exists between two vertices and ensuring correct traversal of graph components.
- **Robust Testing:** Enhanced and extended the provided test suite to validate functionality across various graph structures and edge cases.
